# Building a Parser from scratch

This is a repository from the [Building a Parser from scratch](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/courses/parser-from-scratch/) class.

As mentioned in the course description, we want our students to understand and implement every piece of detail from the parser themselves, instead of copy-pasting from the final solution.

Therefore, the source code here provides only the overall structure of the project, leaving the missing parts as assignments. The _"Implement here..."_ show specific places which are needed to be completed in order to finalize the fully working parser.

Example:

```js
/**
 * FunctionDeclaration
 *   : 'def' Identifier '(' OptFormalParameterList ')' BlockStatement
 *   ;
 */
FunctionDeclaration() {
  // Implement here...
}
```
